# What is Sniff?

Sniff is a CLI-first platform that lets you deploy AI agents to Linear using a simple YAML configuration file. No infrastructure setup, no complex integrations—just a config file and a few commands.

## Why Sniff?

- **Multiple specialized agents**: Deploy as many agent configurations as you need—all appear as one workspace member
- **Config-driven**: One YAML file defines your entire agent. No UI to click through, just pure configuration as code
- **Lightning fast**: From zero to deployed agent in under 2 minutes with 5 CLI commands
- **Bring your own keys**: Use your own API keys. Full control over usage and costs
- **Secure by default**: Multi-tenant architecture with OAuth. Your data and connections stay isolated and protected

## How It Works

When you deploy an agent with Sniff:

1. Your agent appears as a workspace member in Linear
2. Users can @mention or delegate issues to Sniff agent
3. Sniff agent receives webhooks and responds with the selected agent-specific analysis
4. Everything runs on managed infrastructure—no servers to maintain

## Who Is This For?

Sniff is built for developers who want to:

- Automate Linear workflows with AI
- Build custom agents for their team without infrastructure overhead
- Experiment with AI-powered issue management
- Deploy agents that integrate deeply with Linear's Agent Sessions
