# Quickstart Guide

Get your first AI agent running in Linear in under 2 minutes. This guide walks you through the three key steps: authentication, creating a config, and deploying.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- A Linear workspace where you have admin access
- An npm account (for installing the CLI)

## Installation

First, install the Sniff CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @sniff-dev/cli
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
sniff --version
```

## Step 1: Authentication

Log in to Sniff to authenticate your CLI:

```bash
sniff login
```

This will open your browser to:

1. Complete authentication with Clerk
2. Connect your Linear workspace via OAuth
3. Connect your Anthropic API key (for powering your agents)

Once successful, you'll see:

```
✓ Logged in as your-email@example.com

Ready to deploy agents!
Run `sniff init` to create your first agent.
```

Your credentials are securely stored in `~/.sniff/credentials`.

<Note>You need admin permissions in your Linear workspace to complete this step.</Note>

## Step 2: Create Agent Configuration

Initialize a new agent configuration file:

```bash
sniff init
```

This creates a `config.yml` file in your current directory:

```yaml
version: '1.0'

agent:
  id: 'triage-bot'
  name: 'Triage Agent'
  description: 'Automatically triages and classifies incoming issues'

  system_prompt: |
    You are a triage specialist for an engineering team.

    When a new issue is created:
    1. Classify the issue type: bug, feature, question, or task
    2. Set priority: P0 (critical), P1 (high), P2 (medium), P3 (low)
    3. Provide clear reasoning for your classification

    Be concise but thorough in your analysis.

  model:
    anthropic:
      name: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'
      temperature: 0.7
      max_tokens: 2000
```

<Tip>
  Edit the `system_prompt` to customize your agent's behavior. This is where you define what your
  agent does!
</Tip>

## Step 3: Deploy Your Agent

Deploy your agent to Linear:

```bash
sniff deploy
```

The CLI will:

1. Validate your configuration file
2. Upload your agent to Sniff's runtime
3. Register the agent with your Linear workspace

Expected output:

```
✔ Agent "Triage Agent" deployed

✓ Deployment successful!
  ID: b27dcd96-a610-4ebd-ae73-5d7b60a5b3e1
  Connection: 7f41c799-17c2-4fc1-a56c-830f63c3eb17
  Status: Active

Your agent is now listening for Linear events.
Create an issue in Linear to test it!
```

## Verify Deployment

Check that your agent is running:

```bash
sniff list
```

You should see your agent listed:

```bash
Your Agents:

  Triage Agent ● active
    ID: 6b6d78ff-3060-4034-b49a-9686c5560b1f
    Created: 11/7/2025

  Docs Agent ● active
    ID: 67e141f8-31a3-479d-8e57-b828327884f3
    Created: 11/7/2025

  Release Agent ● active
    ID: b27dcd96-a610-4ebd-ae73-5d7b60a5b3e1
    Created: 11/6/2025
```

## Next Steps

Now that your agent is deployed:

1. **Test it out**: Create an issue in Linear and @mention your agent
2. **See how it works**: Read [How It Works](/how-it-works) to understand the agent lifecycle
3. **Customize**: Check out the [Configuration](/configuration) guide to add more capabilities

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="'sniff' command not found">
    Make sure you installed the CLI globally with the `-g` flag. If it still doesn't work, try:

    ```bash
    npx @sniff-dev/cli login
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication fails">
    Clear your credentials and try again:

    ```bash
    rm -rf ~/.sniff/credentials
    sniff login
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Linear connection fails">
    Ensure you have admin permissions in your Linear workspace. Only workspace admins can install agents.
