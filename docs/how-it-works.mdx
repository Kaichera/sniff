# Using Sniff in Linear

Sniff is an AI agent that works like a team member in your Linear workspace. You can @mention it, assign issues to it, and collaborate with it in real-time.

## One Agent, Multiple Personas

In Linear, you'll only see **one agent called "Sniff"**, but it can run different specialized agents depending on what's deployed to your workspace.

For example, your team might deploy multiple agent configurations:

- **Triage Agent** - Classifies and prioritizes issues
- **Docs Search Agent** - Finds answers in documentation
- **Release Notes Agent** - Generates release summaries
- **Sprint Planning Agent** - Helps organize sprints

**They all appear as the same "Sniff" agent in Linear.** When you @mention or assign Sniff:

- **If only one agent is deployed** → Sniff runs that agent automatically
- **If multiple agents are deployed** → Sniff asks you which agent to use for this task

## How to Use Sniff

There are two simple ways to interact with Sniff:

### 1. @Mention Sniff

![@Mention Sniff](/images/linear2.png)

The quickest way is to @mention Sniff in any issue:

```
@Sniff
```

That's it! Sniff will:

- Read the issue details
- Ask which agent to use (if multiple are deployed)
- Run the selected agent and respond

### 2. Assign the Issue to Sniff

![Assign Issue to Sniff](/images/linear3.png)

For ongoing work, assign the issue directly to Sniff:

1. Open any Linear issue
2. Click the assignee field
3. Select Sniff from the dropdown

When you assign an issue:

- **You remain the assignee** (you're responsible)
- **Sniff becomes the delegate** (it does the work)
- Sniff asks which agent to use (if multiple are deployed)

## What You'll See

After you @mention or assign Sniff:

### 1. Agent Selection (If Multiple Agents)

![Agent Selection](/images/linear4.png)

If your team has deployed multiple agents, Sniff will first ask you to choose which one to use:

```
Sniff: "Multiple agents are available. Which one should handle this issue?"
```

Linear will display buttons or a dropdown with the available agents:

- Triage Agent
- Docs Search Agent
- Release Notes Agent

Click the agent you want to use, and Sniff will run it. Each agent knows exactly what to do based on how it's configured.

### 2. Instant Response

Sniff responds within seconds, showing which agent is running:

```
Sniff: "[Triage Agent] Reading the issue and analyzing the problem..."
```

The agent name in brackets tells you which persona is handling the issue.

### 3. Real-Time Updates

![Thinking Process](/images/linear6.png)

As Sniff works, you'll see its thinking process:

- "Looking for similar issues in the workspace"
- "Searching documentation for error code XYZ"
- "Found 3 similar issues from the past month"

### 4. Final Answer

When done, Sniff provides a clear response:

```
Sniff: "[Triage Agent] This appears to be a P1 bug affecting authentication.

Based on my analysis:
- Affects all mobile users (50% of your user base)
- Similar to issues #123 and #456 from last month
- Workaround: users can log in via desktop

Recommended actions:
1. Move to "In Progress" status
2. Assign to mobile team
3. Target for this week's sprint"
```

## What Sniff Can Do

Depending on how your team configured it, Sniff can:

- **Search the web** - Find documentation, error codes, solutions
- **Read web pages** - Pull content from specific URLs
- **Search Linear** - Find similar issues, check status, read comments
- **Deep reasoning** - Use extended thinking for complex problems
